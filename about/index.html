<h1 style="font-family:arial;">About Me</h1>
<p style="font-family:sans-serif";"> My name is Dawit Hiluf Hailu, I am a Molecular Physicist by profession, and recently 
 I am interested in data science, consequently I am learning this new field along with Python coding. I am fascinitated by it, 
 as I can use the newly acquired tool to play with data and make sense of the what numbers tells us about different issues.</p>

<p style="font-family:sans-serif";"> We realize through science that our senses are deceiving us, and if we want to make accurate
description and understanding of the world and the universe, we need extra help which we invented. To look from afar we have to
needed to create telescope, to investigate the very small and tiny world we had to get help from the likes of microscope.
Furthermore, to help us make logical formulations we needed to invent mathematics. Through which, by the way, we not only 
make sesnse of our universe but also are able to communicate with it globaly.</p>

<p style="font-family:sans-serif";"> Mathematics, in Data's case numbers, are the input we use to explore different issues 
pertaining to our environment and ourselves. This ranges from using data to investigate crime, identfiy and lur cutomers to 
buy our product/s, learn about weather, study physical and bioligical data etc. </p>
                                   
 <p style="font-family:sans-serif";"> Of course data need not only be full of numbers, we must point out that we have textual, 
 and audio (and/or video) data too that need some form of analysis. It is my aim in this web pages to write both about Physics and
 data science, share my journey along the way.</p>
