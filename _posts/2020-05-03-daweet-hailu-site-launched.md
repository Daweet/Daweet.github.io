Here we go this is my first post. I followed [JONATHAN MCGLONE](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) steps to build this page. The steps provided by JONATHAN MCGLONE, are very clearly outlined if you want to build your own website, I highly recommend implementing them faithfully. I have been thinking to own a page for a while, but here we go at last I got the courage and the time to putting this website together. This is hosted by [Github pages](https://pages.github.com), and interesting feature of it is that it is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 

As Jonathan says _It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be_. I expected a lot of hurdle to build the web, but the steps outlined -- though I didn't completely understand what it is -- seems to be effective in helping me build my site.

Here is a brief review of how to use markdown that is listed on github pages.

The interestihg that about this websit6e is I can simply use the github provided editor [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Daweet/Daweet.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for my website, and this is done in Markdown files.

# From Markdown to Website pages
So how do you create the web pages? This is actually straight forward. You see once you put somecontent in Markown files you then need to commit to your repository, following which GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, this is done from the content in your Markdown files.

So it is important to have a loot at how to use Markdown. That is what we see next.

### Markdown
What’s Markdown?
Here is a definition provided in the website of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org).
> Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created
> by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages.
> Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to 
>  format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-
>   formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

> For instance, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you 
> add two asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take a while to get used to seeing Markdown 
> syntax in your text, especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications.

Markdown is intuitive, a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. You can write simple blogs, equations, codes with it. Yopu can also share other sites and add images to your blogs and/or files. I suggest to visit website for further exploration [Markdown]https://www.markdownguide.org. 

According to GitHub pages it follows some conventions

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

The following are heading your sections, we can tyhat we have six sizes of heading
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
#### Header 4
##### Header 5
###### Header 6

List can be unroders as shown here 
- Bulleted
- List

or can be ordered 
1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Daweet/Daweet.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
