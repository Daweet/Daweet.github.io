Here we go this is my first post. Please note that I followed [Jonathan McGlone](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) steps to build this page. The steps provided by Jonathan McGlone, are very clearly outlined, and I say, in case you want to build your own website, I highly recommend implementing them faithfully. I have been thinking to own a page for a while, now because of COVID-19 at last I got the courage and the time to putting this website together. This is hosted by [Github pages](https://pages.github.com), and the interesting feature of it is that it is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 

As Jonathan says _It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be_. I expected a lot of hurdle to build the web, but the steps outlined -- though I didn't completely understand what it is -- seems to be effective in helping me build my site.

Here is a brief review of how to use markdown that is listed on github pages.

## Intro to Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

The interestihg thing about this website is I can simply use the github provided editor [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Daweet/Daweet.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for my website, and this is done in Markdown files.
