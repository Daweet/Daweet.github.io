Here we go this is my first post. I followed [JONATHAN MCGLONE](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) steps to build this page. The steps provided by JONATHAN MCGLONE, are very clearly outlined if you want to build your own website, I highly recommend implementing them faithfully. I have been thinking to own a page for a while, but here we go at last I got the courage and the time to putting this website together. This is hosted by [Github pages](https://pages.github.com), and interesting feature of it is that it is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. 

As Jonathan says _It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be_. I expected a lot of hurdle to build the web, but the steps outlined -- though I didn't completely understand what it is -- seems to be effective in helping me build my site.
